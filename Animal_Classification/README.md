## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classification system that *detects and identifies 15 types of animals* from images. Using the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and *transfer learning*, the model learns to recognize each animal by its unique visual features.

This can be the foundation for real-time wildlife monitoring, educational tools, or intelligent animal tagging systems.

## Classes Included

The model classifies the following animal species:

Cat, Dog, Elephant, Horse, Lion, Tiger, Bear, Zebra, Deer, Monkey, Giraffe, Cow, Sheep, Chicken, Fox

## Dataset

- *Input Shape*: 224x224x3 RGB images

## Tech Stack

- *Language*: Python   
- *Libraries*:
  - TensorFlow / Keras
  - NumPy, Pandas
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
  - OpenCV (for preprocessing or real-time extensions)

## Model Architecture

- *Backbone*: MobileNetV2 / ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
- *Classifier Head*:  
  GlobalAveragePooling -> Dense(128) -> Dropout -> Dense(15, softmax)
- *Loss Function*: Categorical Crossentropy  
- *Optimizer*: Adam  
- *Metric*: Accuracy

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Animal-Detection.git
cd Animal-Detection
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

## Results
